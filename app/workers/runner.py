"""Background job runner: drives the graph for one job and persists results.

    try_acquire (atomic) ─▶ run graph (checkpointer, thread_id=job_id) ─▶ persist
            │ already running                     │ on exception
            └─▶ abort (concurrent resume)         └─▶ set FAILED (+ error)

Resume: POST /resume calls run_job(resume=True). The graph continues from the
last checkpoint if one is pending; otherwise it re-invokes from the start, which
is correct AND cheap because every node is idempotent (load-or-produce) — a
resumed image_gen skips frames already on disk instead of re-billing them.

Runs as a fire-and-forget task (FastAPI BackgroundTasks). It owns its OWN DB
session — never the request session. Keeps DB writes here, out of the agents, so
agents stay pure + unit-testable.
