"""Pydantic schemas for jobs, API I/O, and the artifacts that flow between agents.

These are the contracts of the "context engineering" design: agents read/write
small structured artifacts (script, shotlist, frame metadata) and pass them by
*reference*. Binary media (images, video) never lives in these objects — only
paths/ids do.
