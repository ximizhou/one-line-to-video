"""designer agent: Script -> Shotlist + style bible + ONE style reference image.

This is the #1 anti-"AI slop" lever. Independent per-frame generations drift in
character, palette, and composition. The designer locks the look ONCE:

    script.json
        │
        ▼  (LLM) art-direct: write a detailed style_bible + per-shot image_prompts
    shotlist.json  +  style_bible.md
        │
        ▼  (image) render ONE style_ref.png from the bible
    style_ref.png  ──▶ image_gen conditions EVERY frame on it (ref_image=)

Degrade, don't die (Phase 2 decision): the style ref enhances consistency but is
not worth killing a multi-minute job over. If the shotlist LLM fails we fall back
to the raw script scenes; if the style-ref image fails we drop to text-only style
conditioning. Both paths surface a warning — never silent.

Idempotent (resume): every artifact is load-or-produce, so re-entering this node
reuses the existing shotlist/bible/ref instead of regenerating a divergent one.

    "medium & render style, colour palette, lighting, lens/composition language, and the "
    "EXACT recurring look of each named character and setting (so they stay identical "
    "shot to shot). Be specific and reusable — this is the anti-drift contract.\n"
    "(2) 'shots' — EXACTLY one shot per script scene, preserving each scene's 'order' and "
    "'narration'. Each 'image_prompt' is rendered ALONE by the image model (one prompt at "
    "a time, with no memory of the other shots), so it must be SELF-CONTAINED: restate "
    "that scene visually AND bake in the style-bible rules — including each subject's "
    "exact appearance — so the shot generates stand-alone yet still matches the others. "
    "Use each scene's 'beat_role' in the arc to choose framing and energy: establish wide "

    "most dramatic composition, and let the resolution land calmly.\n"
