"""assembler agent: ordered CLEAN frames -> final mp4 with SYNCED narration.

Two visual paths (unchanged):
  enable_motion ON  -> per-frame Ken Burns zoom + caption overlay + crossfades.
  enable_motion OFF -> burn captions + concat stills (hermetic tests, no motion).

Narration (Workstream 5, ON by default): a TTS voice reads EACH caption and that image is
held on screen for exactly the narration's length (audio-driven holds), so audio and
visuals are synced per beat. Each beat's start offset comes from the SAME function the
video uses (xfade_offsets / concat_offsets), so the voice can't drift from the picture.

    caption_NN ─▶ TTS ─▶ narration_NN.wav ─▶ hold_NN = max(floor, len+pad)
                                              │
        holds ─▶ kenburns/concat (video) ─────┼─▶ offsets ─▶ adelay+amix (one track) ─▶ mux

Idempotent: the per-beat WAVs are load-or-produce (narration_NN.wav), so a resume never
re-synthesizes against the ~100/day TTS cap.

Degrade, don't die: a beat whose TTS fails gets silence (image still shows); if the synced
track can't be built we fall back to one continuous track from the audio we already have;
if even that fails the video is left silent. Narration NEVER fails a job.

Silent path (enable_tts off / no tts): the original EXACT-duration uniform holds are used,
so existing duration behaviour + tests are unchanged.
