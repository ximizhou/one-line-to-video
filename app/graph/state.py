"""Shared state for the storyboard LangGraph.

Holds only JSON-serializable *references* (paths) + metadata — never image/video
bytes. This is the context-engineering contract: nodes pass artifacts by
reference, so the graph state (and any checkpoint) stays small.

Non-serializable dependencies (adapters, store) are bound into the nodes via
functools.partial in graph/build.py, NOT carried in state.
