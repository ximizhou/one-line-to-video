                               revise loop)

The `reflection` node (Workstream 3) critiques + revises the script for story
coherence BEFORE the look is locked; the loop is internal (no graph cycle). The
`designer` node (Phase 2) then locks one visual style (style_bible + style_ref)
between scripting and image generation. The shape stays strictly linear.

Deps (adapters, store) are bound into each node via functools.partial so the
graph state remains small + serializable (checkpoint-ready). Pass a `checkpointer`
to persist node-boundary state for resume (thread_id == job_id).

Observability: when ``deps.reporter`` is set, each node is wrapped by
``_instrument`` — it binds the (job_id, stage) contextvar (so every log.* inside
the node is auto-attributed) and emits stage start/finish/fail to ``job_stages``.
The wrapper is TRANSPARENT (returns the node's dict unchanged, re-raises
unchanged) and a pure pass-through when ``reporter is None``, so existing graph
builds + agent unit tests are unaffected.
