"""Issue 2: EVERY pipeline stage emits at least one captured log line.

script_writer / reflection / designer previously logged nothing on their happy
paths, so the front end showed "No logs yet for this stage." for them (video_gen
+ assembler logged, the other three were silent). This is the regression guard:
a full mock run — with the same DBLogHandler main.py's lifespan attaches in prod
(runner.py does NOT attach it) — must capture >=1 job_logs row for EVERY stage,
and the reflection stage must surface the judge SCORE the user specifically asked
to see.
